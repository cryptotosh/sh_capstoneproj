## Overview

This is the solution to the SideHustle cohort 5.0 internship capstone project. The Fylo dark theme landing page challenges our abilities on what we've learnt so far, it also improves our coding skills by building realistic projects.
The interns were grouped into numbers of groups, this will enables us to leanr oncollaboration and team-work
This project was carried out by [GROUP 105](#group-members)

## Our process
The project was designed by the group's members;
We shared every section of the page within ourselves, sent to the group lead who collated and refined the entire page
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What we learned

 - We learnt more about flexbox (we all decided to go with flexbox instead of grid).
 - We learnt more about git, github and it usage
   - Learnt on how to use material icons from frontawesome

Some of our code snippets are seen below:

```html
<ul class="navUL">
    <li><a href="#favourites">favourites</a></li>
    <li><a href="#team">Team</a></li>
    <li><a href="#signin">sign in</a></li>
</ul>
```
```css
footer{
    width: 100%;
    background: hsl(216, 53%, 9%);
    padding: 10rem 3rem 3rem 5rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```
